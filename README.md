This project explores the application of numerical methods in GPS positioning covering satellite coordinates,
receiver position near earth, and transmission time. Specifically, an attempt has been made to use multivariate
Newton-Raphson method to solve or find roots of non-linear systems of equations followed by quadratic
formula to find exact roots of the equation, application of reduced row echelon form (rref) to solve systems
of linear equations, conditioning of GPS problem, measure input and output errors with respect to changes in
coordinates, and calculate error magnification factor when the satellites are bunched and unbunched. Lastly,
the project uses Gauss-Newton method to solve non-linear least squares problem. The project concludes by
stating whether GPS error and conditioning number can be reduced by adding more satellites by comparing the
results when satellites are unbunched with that of bunched satellites.
